## Team Agreement

### Cooperation Plan

#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

- Elias: Gets class components, managing state in React, working on the server/backend.
- Seth: Good at React and debugging.
- Dennis: Feel good about managing state in React and doin fun stuff with APIs.
- Raphael: Feel good about design skills, accomplishing goals once we get them laid out.

#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Frontend: Elias and Seth feel strong in React and its control flow, Raphael feels strong in the design and aesthetics of our site presentation.
Backend: Elias feels confident in his server skills and so does Dennis and both are interested in linking up to some neat APIs.

#### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Elias: Listening.
- Seth: Teamwork.
- Dennis: Listening, public speaking.
- Raphael: Public speaking and articulating ideas.

#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

We'll start with having the MVP clearly communicated, we'll meet at the beginning of the day to discuss goals and todos, and we'll meet up periodically to discuss progress through the day.

### Conflict Plan

#### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Talk about it openly, as long as we communicate clearly this shouldn't be an issue.
We'll be clear about what key issues need consensus.

#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

Same as the first point, talk openly about it and directly with the people in question. Approach it in a constructive way to help build team consensus and not single one person out.

#### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Be up front about your strengths but still try and grow and stretch your abilities.

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If the group agrees that a member has failed to meet team expectations three times and this has been communicated to them without the group seeing a positive change, the group will approach the teacher for intervention.

### Communication Plan

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  Normal class hours (9am -5pm PST).

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone)?
  Discord.

- How often will you take breaks?
  Up to the individual.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  As long as we are realistic with the MVP and goals, this shouldn't be a problem. If there are areas that lag behind, we can reallocate resources.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  No expectation of communication on the weekend or after hours, communicate beforehand if someone needs to be late to the start of day meeting.

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  Maintain an open talking environment, self-police for ranting. Actively seek out people's concerns.

### Work Plan

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  We'll use Trello as needs be, we'll reference our wireframes and MVP to see what is outstanding to be done.

- What project management tool will be used?
  Trello.

### Git Process

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  Frontend and backend components.

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  We have an organization.

- What is your Git flow?
  Main branch: We only have one person submit a PR, two people will approve, we will only do this once or twice.
  Development branch: A merge to this branch will require the approval of one other person (communicate this to the team that this is needed). This can be done as needed.

- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  Communicate this at meeting times and do code review at designated meetings.
